# A Note on the Archives Listed
The archives below host a variety of perspectives, though admittedly, most of them host American-based materials. Universities in El Salvador are not well-funded, and thus, any archives do exist  are not accessible (to my knowledge) to a wide, online audience. Consistent searches asking for source materials to be in archival institutions <i>outside</i> the U.S. came up empty. Additionally, many of the links below only have physical objects, accessed via a reading room and in some cases, contain dead links and defunct contact information. This list serves doubly: as a window of a resource, and as a magnifying classs. These links house some very interesting content and can provide some research starting points -- through collections of Salvadoran student protest materials, letters between ambassadors discussing the Salvadoran Civil War, even some American critical reflection on their role in Salvadoran affairs. However, it also magnifies so much content not shown -- content that may begin to fill knowledge gaps about topics such as puppet governemnts that led to the explosive Civil War, immigration, and El Salvador's recovery process. It's up to the user to determine the utility of each source, so I deeply encourage critical exploration.
