John the Evangelist wrote about the passion of Christ, how he and Mary stood with anguished spirits before the holy cross where the Savior was hung. Then He said to His own mother, &ldquo;Woman, look, here is your son.&rdquo; Next He said to John, &ldquo;Look now, here stands your mother.&rdquo; From that day, John the Evangelist looked after Saint Mary, and with attentive service obeyed her as his own mother.<sup id="cite_4"><a draggable="false" href="#4">[4]</a></sup></seg></tuv> </tu> <tu creationdate="20230204T230037Z" creationid="LF Aligner 3.12"><prop type="Txt::Note">AssumptionMaryOE-AssumptionMaryME</prop> <tuv xml:lang="EN"><seg>5.

The Lord, through His goodness, entrusted the Blessed Virgin, His mother, to that upright man John, who had ever lived in perpetual virginity; and therefore he was specially dear to the Lord, to the point that He would entrust him with the most precious treasure, the queen of all the world&mdash;undoubtedly so that her own most pure chastity might be joined with that of this upright man, with pleasing companionship and agreeable conversation. They shared the virtue of unbroken chastity, but in Mary there was something else: her virginity was fruitful, like no one else&rsquo;s. No other person has kept their virginity after they&rsquo;ve been fruitful, nor could they be fruitful if they&rsquo;ve kept their virginity. Now both Mary&rsquo;s virginity and her fruitfulness are revered in the divine birth, and she surpasses all others in virginity and in fruitfulness. However, though she was specially entrusted to John&rsquo;s care, she lived in the company of the apostles after Christ&rsquo;s ascension, going in and out among them, and they all served her with much devotion and love. She also told them plainly all manner of things about Christ&rsquo;s humanity, for she had learned all these things from the beginning through the Holy Ghost and had seen them with her own eyes. The apostles understood all these things through the same Spirit, and were learned in all truth. The Archangel Gabriel kept her undefiled, and she dwelled in the care of John and all the apostles, in that communion of saints, meditating on God&rsquo;s law: until God, on this day, called her to the heavenly throne and exalted her over the multitude of angels.</seg></tuv> </tu> <tu creationdate="20230204T230037Z" creationid="LF Aligner 3.12"><prop type="Txt::Note">AssumptionMaryOE-AssumptionMaryME</prop> <tuv xml:lang="EN"><seg>6.

Her end is not written about in any book more clearly than this, that she departed from the body in glory. Her tomb can be seen by all who look even to this present day in the middle of the Valley of Jehosophat: the valley is between Mount Zion and the Mount of Olives, and the tomb is visibly open and empty. In her honor a church has been raised upon it with wondrous stonework. No mortal man knows how or when her holy body was taken away from there, or where it was carried, or whether she rose from the dead&mdash;though some scholars say that her Son, who mightily arose from the dead on the third day, also raised His mother&rsquo;s body from the dead, and with immortal splendor placed it in the heavenly kingdom. Likewise, many scholars have set in their books how regenerated men, risen with Christ from the dead, are raised forever. Indeed, they confess that these raised men are not true witnesses of Christ&rsquo;s resurrection unless they themselves are raised forever.<sup id="cite_7"><a draggable="false" href="#7">[7]</a></sup> Nor do we reject the eternal resurrection of the Blessed Mary, though for caution&rsquo;s sake, preserving our faith, it behooves us that we merely hope for it rather than foolishly and without reproach state as fact that which is unknowable.</seg></tuv> </tu> <tu creationdate="20230204T230037Z" creationid="LF Aligner 3.12"><prop type="Txt::Note">AssumptionMaryOE-AssumptionMaryME</prop> <tuv xml:lang="EN"><seg>7.

We read everywhere in our books how angels often appeared at the death of good men, and with spiritual hymns of love led their souls to heaven. It is even more certain that those people heard the songs of men and of women at their death too, accompanied by a great light and a sweet smell. By this we know that holy people who have come to God&rsquo;s kingdom accompanied by good deeds receive the souls of other people at their deaths, and with great joy lead them to rest. Now, if the Savior has shown such honor so often to His holy departed and commands that their souls be fetched to Him with heavenly singing, how much more do you think that He would send that heavenly host to gather His own mother, that with blinding light and unutterable hymns they should lead her to the throne which was prepared for her from the beginning of the world?</seg></tuv> </tu> <tu creationdate="20230204T230037Z" creationid="LF Aligner 3.12"><prop type="Txt::Note">AssumptionMaryOE-AssumptionMaryME</prop> <tuv xml:lang="EN"><seg>8.

All the chosen who have been sanctified by God through martyrdom or purity journey with the blessed queen, because she herself is both martyr and maiden. She is as lovely as a dove, because she loved that meekness which the Holy Ghost symbolized when He was seen in the likeness of a dove over Christ at His baptism. Other martyrs suffered martyrdom in their bodies for their faith in Christ; the Blessed Mary was not bodily martyred, but her soul was sorely vexed with much suffering when she stood sorrowful at the foot of the cross of Christ and saw her beloved child hung with iron nails on the hard tree. Therefore, she is more than a martyr, because she suffered martyrdom in her soul, while other martyrs suffered in their bodies. She loved Christ above all other men, and so her affliction with Him was also greater than that of other men, and she made His death as her own death because His suffering pierced her soul like a sword.</seg></tuv> </tu> <tu creationdate="20230204T230037Z" creationid="LF Aligner 3.12"><prop type="Txt::Note">AssumptionMaryOE-AssumptionMaryME</prop> <tuv xml:lang="EN"><seg>11.

On the third night of the fast, the bishop saw a great heavenly host on either side of the temple, and in the midst of that troop sat the heavenly queen Mary, who said to her attendants: &ldquo;Call for the martyr Mercurius,<sup id="cite_19"><a draggable="false" href="#19">[19]</a></sup> that he might go to the wicked apostate Julian and kill him who, puffed up with pride, has renounced God my son.&rdquo; Saint Mercurius the Martyr quickly came armed, and went off at her bidding.

If anyone wonders how this took place, we teach that this martyr had lived as a member of the laity, until he was martyred for his faith in Christ through the persecution of heathens. Afterward, Christian men placed his holy body inside the temple with much honor, together with his weapons. Later then, when the holy queen sent him, as we have already described, his spirit swiftly went forth and stabbed the fiend of God with a physical weapon, while the guards looked on.</seg></tuv> </tu> <tu creationdate="20230204T230037Z" creationid="LF Aligner 3.12"><prop type="Txt::Note">AssumptionMaryOE-AssumptionMaryME</prop> <tuv xml:lang="EN"><seg>22.

My most beloved brothers, let us cry out with unceasing prayer to the holy mother of God, that she might intercede for us with her son at our hour of need. We ought to believe that he will grant many things to her through whom He Himself deigned to be born as a human for the redemption of the world, He Who has ever been God without beginning and now continues in one person, true human and true God, unto the ages of ages. Just as every man exists in soul and in body as one person, so is Christ God and man as one Savior, who lives and reigns with the Father and the Holy Ghost, forever and ever, world without end. Amen.</seg></tuv> </tu> </tmx>

<h3>Notes</h3>

<ol>
    <li id="1">OE <em>sacerd</em> can mean ‘priest,’ but it is not confined to the Christian priesthood. It derives from Latin <em>sacerdos</em> ‘priest, priestess, cleric.’ To me, it seems as though Ælfric is emphasizing Jerome’s entire religious role, and not just his priesthood (which could be expressed with OE <em>preost</em>).</li>

    <li id="2">OE <em>cennestre</em> is a particularly profound word. Generally speaking, it means ‘one who has borne a child; mother,’ but it also carries a sense of ‘one who produces; one who brings forth.’ The term seems to unite carrying a child and then delivering. The importance of ‘carrying’ leads me to translate the word as <em>Theotokos</em>, from the Greek meaning ‘God-bearer.’  (See also note 11 in the homily on the <em>Nativity of All Saints</em>.)</li>

    <li id="3">St. Paula of Rome was an aristocrat who established a convent and a monastery in Bethlehem after her husband’s death. Paula was the abbess, followed by her daughter Eustochium. The pair traveled and worked alongside Jerome, who had himself settled in the monastery Paula had established.</li>

    <li id="4">Cf. John 19:25–27.</li>

    <li id="5">‘Unbroken chastity’ is likely the most literal translation.</li>

    <li id="6">It is literally ‘mannishness,’ and it seems wrong to do away with that compounding.</li>

    <li id="7">Cf. 1 Corinthians 15:13.</li>

    <li id="8">Exodus 20:12; Ephesians 6:2.</li>

    <li id="9">John 8:49.</li>

    <li id="10">Song of Songs 6:10.</li>

    <li id="11">This reference is harder to place. Ælfric seems to draw from various descriptions of the lovers in Song of Songs, applying them to Mary (cf. Song of Songs 2:1, 4:11, 5:12, etc.)</li>

    <li id="12">Cf. John 14:2.</li>

    <li id="13">Cf. Psalm 22:2; 52:9.</li>

    <li id="14">Ælfric’s attention returns to the people he is writing to. ‘You’ here moves away from Paula, Eustochium, and the other women.</li>

    <li id="15">Theophilus of Adana.</li>

    <li id="16">Julian the Apostate.</li>

    <li id="17">Basil the Great.</li>

    <li id="18">That is, Basil says that Julian must consider himself an irrational beast, if that’s the food he offers in return.</li>

    <li id="19">Saint Mercurius, a Saracen soldier who became a Christian saint and martyr.</li>

    <li id="20">Libanius was a friend of Julian, who taught rhetoric in the Eastern Roman Empire.</li>

    <li id="21">The OE <em>worulda woruld</em> evokes the same spatio-temporal sense of the Greek εἰς τοὺς αἰῶνας τῶν αἰώνων [<em>eis toùs aionas ton aiṓnōn</em>]. This is variously translated: ‘unto the ages of ages’; ‘forever and ever’; ‘from eternity to eternity’; or perhaps, ‘as it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be.’ Ælfric uses this construction regularly in these homilies, and I’ve selected the Church of England’s ‘world without end’; this captures both the temporal and spatial components.</li>
