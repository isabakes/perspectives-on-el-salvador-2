His adversary in all his doings was a magician named Simon: this magician was so filled with a cursed spirit that he said he was Christ, the son of God, and with his witchcraft he corrupted the faith of the people.<sup id="cite_17"><a draggable="false" href="#17">[17]</a></sup></seg></tuv> </tu> <tu creationdate="20230204T234136Z" creationid="LF Aligner 3.12"><prop type="Txt::Note">PeterPaulOE-PeterPaulME</prop> <tuv xml:lang="EN"><seg>14. &THORN;a gelamp hit &thorn;&aelig;t man ferede anre wuduwan suna lic &eth;&aelig;r Petrus bodigende w&aelig;s.

The emperor was then astonished by these words. Simon said, &ldquo;Good king, you do not understand the conspiracy between these two men against me. I am Truth, but these men were already opposed to me. Command that a high tower be built at once, that I might climb up, because my angels will not come down to me on earth near these sinful men. Then I will ascend to my father and order my angels to fetch you to my kingdom.&rdquo; Nero replied, &ldquo;I will see if you actually fulfill this promise.&rdquo; So he commanded that the tower be built quickly on a flat plain, and ordered all his people to gather to see this spectacle. The magician climbed the tower in front of all the people, and with outstretched arms he flew up into the sky as with wings.</seg></tuv> </tu> <tu creationdate="20230204T234136Z" creationid="LF Aligner 3.12"><prop type="Txt::Note">PeterPaulOE-PeterPaulME</prop> <tuv xml:lang="EN"><seg>23.

Paul said to Peter, &ldquo;Brother, you were chosen by God before me: it is fitting that you bring down this servant of the devil with your prayers. I will also bend my knees in the same prayer.&rdquo; Then Peter looked up at the flying magician and said, &ldquo;I exorcize you cursed spirits, in the name of Christ, that you forsake this magician whom you carry between yourselves.&rdquo; The devils abandoned him at once, and Simon fell and broke into four pieces; and those four pieces were impaled on four stones, which are a testament to the apostolic victory on this day. Peter&rsquo;s initial hesitation allowed these hellish fiends to carry Simon up into the air for quite a distance, so that his failure would be more severe; so that he who had arrogantly flown with devilish wings just a second before might promptly plummet down. It was appropriate that he was lifted up high, so that in the sight of all people he would fall headlong to the earth.</seg></tuv> </tu> <tu creationdate="20230204T234136Z" creationid="LF Aligner 3.12"><prop type="Txt::Note">PeterPaulOE-PeterPaulME</prop> <tuv xml:lang="EN"><seg>24.

Peter said, &ldquo;Simon will not return to life before the general resurrection; instead, he is condemned to eternal torment.&rdquo; Nero, the enemy of God, consulted with his chief prefect Agrippa and ordered Paul to be beheaded and Peter to be crucified. Paul, at the executioner&rsquo;s word, submitted to the edge of the sword; Peter ascended to the crucifixion. As he was led to the cross, Peter said to the executioner, &ldquo;I ask you, turn my head down and stretch my feet toward heaven. I am not worthy to hang as my Lord did.

You should know that this worst of kings, Nero, could not govern his kingdom after the death of these apostles. It so happened that all the people under that bloodthirsty emperor hated him, and so they unanimously decided to bind him and beat him to death. When Nero learned of the people&rsquo;s resolve, he feared for his life and fled in haste to the woods. Then word spread that he dwelled there so long, cold and hungry, until wolves tore him apart. After this, the Greeks took the bodies of the apostles and would have carried them off to the East; but all of a sudden there was a great earthquake, and the Roman people rushed forward and secured the bodies in the place which is called the Catacombs. They held them there for a year and a half, until the places were built where the saints&rsquo; bodies would later be laid with glory and songs of praise. It is known among all people that many miracles happened at the tombs of the apostles, at the Savior&rsquo;s permission. To Him be glory and praise always until eternity. Amen.</seg></tuv> </tu> </tmx>

<h3>Notes</h3>

<ol>
    <li id="1">The Gospel reading for this feast day, the Latin reads: ‘Jesus came into the regions of Caesarea Philippi: and the rest…’ (Matthew 16:13).</li>

    <li id="2">This is literally ‘Gospell-er’ or ‘one who does Gospels.’ It seems a shame to lose a lovely little word like ‘Gospeller.’</li>

    <li id="3">Curiously, Ælfric uses an adjectival form (‘stony; stone-like’) instead of a nominative. Most translations of this Gospel say that Peter is not just like a stone, but that he is the stone. Here, Ælfric emphasizes the stone-like qualities of Peter.</li>

    <li id="4">Matthew 16:13–19.</li>

    <li id="5">The Venerable Saint Bede (c. 672–735) was well-known for his extensive ecumenical writings, including his commentaries on both the Old and New Testaments. He’s best remembered, however, for his <em>Ecclesiastical History of the English People</em>.</li>

    <li id="6">Cf. Psalm 82:6 and John 10:34.</li>

    <li id="7">I can’t help but see this as a reference to the Cerne Abbas Giant, a large chalk hill figure near Cerne Abbey, where Ælfric was writing. The age of the giant is uncertain, and scholars have posited dates ranging from the 700s to the 17th century. However, Ælfric makes frequent reference throughout his homilies to the pagan worship of giants, and the proximity of the hill figure to the abbey seems too much of a coincidence to me. Ælfric, a product of and participant in the early English Benedictine Reform, admits in his Preface to this collection that correcting popular heresy was a primary motivation of these homilies.</li>

    <li id="8">Psalm 115:4–7; Psalm 135:15–17.</li>

    <li id="9">OE <em>culfran</em> ‘of the dove’ is a translation of Peter’s title in the Bible, <em>bar Jonah</em> ‘son of Jonah’ or ‘son of the dove.’ It’s unclear if Ælfric would understand Jonah as the literal name of Peter’s father as well, or if the metaphorical interpretation is the primary one.</li>

    <li id="10">1 Corinthians 10:4. However, this is not unique to Paul, and clearer references seem to be made by Luke, Peter, and Jesus himself throughout the New Testament.</li>

    <li id="11">Cf. 1 Peter 2:4–10.</li>

    <li id="12">Cf. 1 Corinthians 3:10–15.</li>

    <li id="13">Cf. 1 Corinthians 10:13.</li>

    <li id="14">John 20:22–23. In this reference to John, Jesus breathes only on his disciples; it’s not until Pentecost in the book of Acts that all the apostles receive the Spirit.</li>

    <li id="15">The following story is drawn from the apocryphal text <em>The Acts of Peter and Paul</em>. Various versions of this pseudepigraphical story circulated during the Middle Ages, including a version called (as here) <em>Passio sanctorum Petri et Pauli</em>. See also Blickling Homily 15 <em>Spel be Petrus & Paulus</em>.</li>

    <li id="16">Ælfric uses a handful of different terms to describe Simon and what he does. ‘Magician’ is certainly the easiest solution, but I’m not pleased with translating <em>drycræft</em> as ‘magic’; ‘sorcerer’ and ‘sorcerery’ offer a nice pair, but the suffix <em>-craft</em> is particularly evocative, so ‘magician’ and ‘witchcraft’ seems like a suitable balance. I also toyed with using ‘druid/druidcraft,’ to illustrate how the church might use the paganism of England in their Christian teaching.</li>

    <li id="17">Simon Magus, or Simon the Sorcerer, is first mentioned as an opponent of Peter in Acts 8:9–24. He developed a kind of mythology over time.</li>

    <li id="18">The ‘cursed persecutor’ is Nero; Simon Magus is ‘the devil’s servant.’</li>

    <li id="19">Here Ælfric follows Eusebius’ traditional claim in <em>Historia Ecclesiastica</em> that Paul was not martyred when he was first brought to Rome as a prisoner (recounted throughout the book of Acts), but that he returned some years later of his own accord. It’s curious that this Latin explanation is not glossed or explained for a lay congregation, while the rest of the story is thoroughly described.</li>

    <li id="20">Nero’s official wives include Claudia Octavia, Poppaea Sabina, and Statilia Messalina. Perhaps this is a reference to Poppaea Sabina (also known as Ollia), the second wife of Nero. The historian Josephus notes that that Poppaea was a θεοσεβής [theosebês] ‘worshiper of God,’ though even this epithet is uncertain (see Baughman et al.’s <a href="https://wjudaism.library.utoronto.ca/index.php/wjudaism/article/view/22531/18323" target="_blank">“Poppaea Sabina, Jewish Sympathies, and the Fire of Rome”</a>).</li>

    <li id="21">As with Livia above, the reference is uncertain. Agrippina and Livia were exceptionally common names, and perhaps the original source of this account, <a href="https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Ante-Nicene_Fathers/Volume_VIII/Apocrypha_of_the_New_Testament/Acts_of_the_Holy_Apostles_Peter_and_Paul/Acts_of_the_Holy_Apostles_Peter_and_Paul" target="_blank">the Acts of the Holy Apostles Peter and Paul</a>, chose them as suitable every-women, with the added emphasis of them being members of Nero’s own household.</li>

    <li id="22">The OE uses the same word for ‘fisherman’ twice in this passage. However, I wanted to capture both the disdain of ‘fisherman’ and the accused craftiness of ‘angler.’ The pun on "angel" and "angler" is a nice bonus.</li>

    <li id="23">The inversion of 'god' to 'dog' is wholly coincidental in translation. The OE reads godcundlice and hundlice.</li>

    <li id="24">Cf. Romans 15:19. This is a distance of about 1,000 miles.</li>

    <li id="25">Compare this last sentence with Matthew 28:18–19.</li>

    <li id="26">This phrase, <em>þæt he ða færlice his feðe forlure</em> ‘that he might suddenly lose his footing,’ displays uncharacteristic alliteration. I wanted to maintain this alliteration in translation.</li>

    <li id="27">Cf. 1 Peter 5:2–4.</li>
</ol>
