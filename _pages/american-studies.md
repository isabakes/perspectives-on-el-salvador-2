  “What’s little understood is that the mass exodus to the United States earlier this year was actually 30 years in the making, fueled by American foreign policy decisions in the early 1980s and an act of Congress in the mid 1990s.”

  Hanging in my Brighton apartment kitchen is a clunky-looking wooden decoration, gifted to my husband by his father as a house-warming present. I remember eyeing it when I first visited his Harvard dormitory sophomore year of college, as it stood out starkly against the pop culture posters and hastily painted walls of the century-old Cambridge building. The piece was the only “Salvadoran” identifier in the room – it contained strung prints of a defunct Salvadoran form of currency, and was crowned with colorful graphics and phrases boasting of El Salvador’s “magical” qualities.

  My father-in-law – a Salvadoran immigrant himself – purchased this decoration in San Miguelito market in San Salvador. The market is one of many in El Salvador that serves as a shopping hub – where vendors sell food, clothing, and handmade crafts and artisanal items. It is important to note that many of the artisanal items, mostly art pieces and housewares made out of clay or wood and then painted, are sold right alongside cheaper looking, mass-printed items. These mass-made objects are characterized by choppy (not well-integrated) graphic design, fuzzy or poor quality printed images, and are usually on some sort of factory-made base, like a plain t-shirt, plain white mug, etc. The existence of two types of commodities – hand-made versus machine-made – elicits a complex narrative about cultural production that can be further explained by looking at colonial hierarchies.
