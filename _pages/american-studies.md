  “What’s little understood is that the mass exodus to the United States earlier this year was actually 30 years in the making, fueled by American foreign policy decisions in the early 1980s and an act of Congress in the mid 1990s.”

  Hanging in my Brighton apartment kitchen is a clunky-looking wooden decoration, gifted to my husband by his father as a house-warming present. I remember eyeing it when I first visited his Harvard dormitory sophomore year of college, as it stood out starkly against the pop culture posters and hastily painted walls of the century-old Cambridge building. The piece was the only “Salvadoran” identifier in the room – it contained strung prints of a defunct Salvadoran form of currency, and was crowned with colorful graphics and phrases boasting of El Salvador’s “magical” qualities.

  My father-in-law – a Salvadoran immigrant himself – purchased this decoration in San Miguelito market in San Salvador. The market is one of many in El Salvador that serves as a shopping hub – where vendors sell food, clothing, and handmade crafts and artisanal items. It is important to note that many of the artisanal items, mostly art pieces and housewares made out of clay or wood and then painted, are sold right alongside cheaper looking, mass-printed items. These mass-made objects are characterized by choppy (not well-integrated) graphic design, fuzzy or poor quality printed images, and are usually on some sort of factory-made base, like a plain t-shirt, plain white mug, etc. The existence of two types of commodities – hand-made versus machine-made – elicits a complex narrative about cultural production that can be further explained by looking at colonial hierarchies.

  Handmade crafts and artisanal items have been historically central to Salvadoran culture and even social survival, especially during the height of Spanish colonialism. Following the early sixteenth century Spanish invasion of Central America, what is now present-day El Salvador was considered on the “periphery,” meaning, it was a nation “outside of the modern and developed center.” (Osegueda and Ricardo 1) Furthermore, a racial hierarchy was formed that influenced social mobility and economic standing for different “classes” of people within a nation with minimized colonial potential. This ethnic division where “Spaniards were above all others, followed by “Indios,” and, finally, enslaved Africans,” reflected this socioeconomic hierarchy (Osegueda and Ricardo 2). The “Indios” (indigenous people) who were towards the bottom of the hierarchy thus “had to engage in craft activities or share their subsistence tasks” (Osegueda and Ricardo 2). In short, crafting and low-level artisanal production have historically characterized the Salvadoran economy, following their presumed “periphery” status. 
  
	Today, this importance in crafts and artisanal items is reflected through marketed tourist activities. El Salvador tourism sites boast about the six cities of the “El Salvador Arts and Crafts Route,” taking you through the towns of Ilobasco, San Ignacio, La Palma, Suchitoto, Citala, and San Sebastian (Galdamez). I myself have visited the town of Ilobasco, which is lined with open buildings filled with these crafts. It is fascinating to note that despite the historical significance of hand-made items, from a distance, they appear no different from machine-made items.
