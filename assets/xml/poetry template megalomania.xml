            <note xml:id="no1">Marx often critiqued class issues, namely to do with property relations. Dalton refers to the "high and mighty"
            Germans, who were a foremost military and world power during Frederick II's reign. Dalton here recognizes the downfall of powerful
            structures, even ones on a national scale,like the Catholic church. He also betrays a level of atheism inherent in Marxism as he 
            criticized the Pope's dictator-like power to abide by religion over science.  </note>
            <note xml:id="no2">Dalton seems to be laying out the consequences for class/political hierarchies. Power structures do not easily
            allow a change of the status quo, even if that change is clearly for the better of the masses.</note>
            <note xml:id="no3">Another instance of a significant member of the "logical" sciences, creating something to better the masses,
            and being punished for it.</note>
            <note xml:id="no4">This is another example of class politics rhetoric, specifically referring to areas near cities that profit off
            urban resources and centrality, without engaging with the downfalls and poverties of urban life. </note>
            <note xml:id="no5">Another appeal against organized religion in comparison to his list of martyrs..</note>
